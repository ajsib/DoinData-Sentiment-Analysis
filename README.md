# DoinData: Sentiment Analysis on Twitter for Polarization Prediction

## Overview

DoinData is a collaborative project aimed at analyzing Twitter sentiment to predict ideological polarization, with a particular focus on the impact of misinformation. Through advanced data analysis techniques, we explore how digital discourse shapes public sentiment, contributing to the development of a more informed and critical online environment. This project is undertaken as part of CISC 271 Advanced Data Analysis.

## Motivation

The proliferation of social media has significantly influenced how information is shared and perceived, often leading to increased division. By leveraging neural network architectures and machine learning algorithms, our study focuses on predicting sentiment polarization on Twitter. Our goal is to mitigate the divisive effects of misinformation and foster a nuanced understanding of online discourse.

## Related Work

Our research builds upon previous studies in sentiment analysis, incorporating methodologies from works by S.C. Nistor et al., Gautam et al., AminiMotlagh et al., and Wang et al., among others. These studies underline the potential of RNN architectures, the effectiveness of Naive Bayes with semantic analysis tools, and the reliability of data mining classifiers in sentiment analysis. We aim to extend these approaches to analyze sentiment polarization and the impact of misinformation.

## Research Questions and Methodology

We address three main research questions:

1. Can learning models predict ideological splits in public sentiment on Twitter regarding specific topics?
2. How does the presence of misinformation influence sentiment polarity on Twitter?
3. What linguistic features contribute most significantly to predicting sentiment shifts in Twitter discourse over time?

Our methodologies include exploratory analysis using clustering algorithms, comparative analysis of sentiment polarity with a focus on misinformation, and feature selection techniques to identify significant linguistic features related to sentiment shifts.

## Dataset

Our analysis utilizes a dataset of 7,291 tweets, sourced from the Twitter API and available on Kaggle. The dataset includes a dummy variable for sentiment (negative or positive) and the full text of tweets, providing a foundation for sentiment analysis and model evaluation.
